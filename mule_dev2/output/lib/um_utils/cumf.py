CUMF (Compare UM FieldsFiles) is a utility to assist in examining UM files.

Usage:

 * Compare :class:`mule.UMFile` objects with the
   :class:`UMFileComparison` class:

    >>> comp = UMFileComparison(umfile_object1, umfile_object2)

 * This object can be manually examined for details, or you can print either
   a short summary or a full report (note a full report is a super-set of a
   summary report):

   >>> summary_report(comp)
   >>> full_report(comp)

    .. Note::
       The field difference objects behave like the original fields, but their
       data stores the absolute differences.  You could retrieve the data
       using "get_data" to examine it, or write it out to a file.

Global comparison settings:

    The module contains a global "COMPARISON_SETTINGS" dictionary, which
    defines default values for the various options; these may be overidden
    for an entire script/session if desired, or in a startup file e.g.

    >>> from um_utils import cumf
    >>> cumf.COMPARISON_SETTINGS["ignore_missing"] = True

    Alternatively each of these settings may be supplied to the main comparison
    class as keyword arguments.  The available settings are:

    * ignore_templates:
        A dictionary indicating which indices should be ignored when making
        comparisons.  The keys give the names of the components and the values
        are lists of the indices to ignore
        (e.g. {"fixed_length_header": [1,2,3], "lookup": [5,42]})
        (default: ignore creation time in fixed length header only)

    * ignore_missing:
        Flag which sets all positional header indices to be ignored - this is
        useful if the file objects being compared have fields which are
        missing from either file. (default: False)

    * only_report_failures:
        Flag which indicates that the printed output should not contain any
        sections which are simply stating that they agree.  (This cuts down
        on the amount of output for larger files). (default:True)

    * lookup_print_func:
        A callback function which is called for each printed field comparison
        to provide extra information about the fields.  It will be passed 2
        arguments - the comparison field and the stdout object to write to.

    * show_missing:
        Flag which causes a list of fields missing from each file to be
        generated in the report. (default: False)

    * show_missing_max:
        Maximum number of missing fields to display. Set to -1 to indicate no
        maximum. (default: -1)
