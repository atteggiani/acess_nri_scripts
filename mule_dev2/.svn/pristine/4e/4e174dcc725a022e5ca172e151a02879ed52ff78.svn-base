File 1: [Test generated file 1]
File 2: [Test generated file 2]
Files DO NOT compare
  * 1 differences in fixed_length_header (with 7 ignored indices)
  * 1 differences in integer_constants (with 0 ignored indices)
  * 5 differences in level_dependent_constants (with 0 ignored indices)

Compared 0/14 fields, with 0 matches
7 fields found in file 1 were not in file 2
7 fields found in file 2 were not in file 1
Not listing specific missing fields, because all fields are missing from both files. (No fields are common.)
